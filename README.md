# Random and Uncomfortable Concerto Generator

## Overview
This Python project generates unique and unpredictable concertos, each a blend of random notes and rhythms, creating a symphony of chaos and musical curiosity. Perfect for those who seek to explore the uncharted territories of sound and rhythm.

## Features
- **Random Note Generation**: Creates notes with optional sharps and flats.
- **Uncomfortable Rhythms**: Includes unusual rhythms for an added layer of complexity.
- **Multiple Concertos**: Ability to generate multiple concertos at once, each with a specified length.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Setup
No additional libraries are required. Just clone this repository or download the `concerto_generator.py` file.

## Usage
Run the script in your Python environment. Modify the parameters in the `create_multiple_concertos` function call to generate different sets of concertos.

```python
# Example: Generate 3 concertos, each with 5 elements
multiple_concertos = create_multiple_concertos(3, 5)
print(multiple_concertos)
```
